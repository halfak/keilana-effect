In this paper, I introduce a novel measurement strategy.  By repeatedly applying the modeling strategy developed by Warncke-Wang et al to the historical versions of Wikipedia articles, the dynamics of their quality can be examined at a granularity that was not possible until now.  Using this measurement strategy, I have demonstrate that topics of high importance to Wikimedia and Wikipedia editors (biographies about women scientists) can be examined in novel ways and new insights can be gained.  I've also linked directly to a public release of open licensed data and an openly available API for generating new predictions that I hope will enable others to more easily explore similar analyses and analysis strategies.
