The 6 levels of assessment are provided with the ``readers experience'' description copied from Wikipedia\protect\footnote{\url{https://enwp.org/Wikipedia:WikiProject_assessment}}.  Each level also has a well-defined, detailed set of assessment criteria that involves discussion of formatting, coverage, and proper sourcing.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{7cm}|} \hline
& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{summary} \\
\hline
FA & Professional, outstanding, and thorough; a definitive source for
encyclopedic information.\\ \hline
GA & Useful to nearly all readers, with no obvious problems; approaching
(but not equalling) the quality of a professional
encyclopedia.\\ \hline
B & Readers are not left wanting, although the content may not be
complete enough to satisfy a serious student or
researcher.\\ \hline
C & Useful to a casual reader, but would not provide a complete picture
for even a moderately detailed study.\\ \hline
Start & Provides some meaningful content, but most readers will need
more.\\ \hline
Stub & Provides very little meaningful content; may be little more than
a dictionary definition.\\ \hline
