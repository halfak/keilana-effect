\caption{ORES wp10 fitness statistics. The fitness statistics of ORES ``wp10'' model based on 10-fold cross-validation are shown in table format.  Note that ``within-1'' accuracy represents the per-class accuracy measure where being off by one is considered a successful prediction.  The overall accuracy is 62.9\% and the within-1 accuracy is 90.7\%.  These figures compare favorably to \protect\cite{wang15success} of 58.2\% and 89.5\% respectively.  I've included the ROC-AUC metric to demonstrate that the probability estimates made by the model are generally useful.  As in \protect\cite{wang15success}, I also find that B- and C-class show lower overall fitness than other classes.}
